# ðŸ“± How Users Can Access Your FitExplorer App

## The QR Code on Your Landing Page

Yes, there is a QR code on your landing page, but it was pointing to a Snack URL instead of your actual Expo app. I've fixed this!

## âœ… What I Fixed

1. **Removed the Snack URL** from the redirect page
2. **Updated the QR code** to redirect users to your website
3. **Added clear instructions** for users to access your Expo app

## ðŸŽ¯ How Users Can Access Your App

### Option 1: Direct Website Access (QR Code)
- Users scan the QR code on your landing page
- They get redirected to `www.fitexplorer.se`
- They can use your website directly in their mobile browser

### Option 2: Expo Go App (Native Experience)
1. **Download Expo Go** from App Store/Google Play
2. **Open Expo Go** app
3. **Tap "Enter URL manually"**
4. **Enter:** `https://www.fitexplorer.se`
5. **Your app loads** with native mobile features!

## ðŸ”§ For Development/Testing

When you want to test your Expo app locally:

1. **Start your Expo server:**
   ```bash
   cd mobile-app/FitExplorerApp
   npx expo start --clear
   ```

2. **Get the QR code** from the terminal
3. **Scan with Expo Go** to test your local app

## ðŸ“± User Experience

- **QR Code users:** Get redirected to your website (works immediately)
- **Expo Go users:** Get the native app experience with your website content
- **Both options:** Access your deployed FitExplorer at `www.fitexplorer.se`

## ðŸŽ‰ Result

Users no longer see the Snack URL error! They can either:
- Use your website directly (via QR code)
- Use Expo Go for a native app experience
- Both options load your actual deployed website
