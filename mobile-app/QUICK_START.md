# ðŸš€ Quick Start - FitExplorer Mobile App

## The Problem
Your Expo app was showing a Snack URL instead of loading your deployed website.

## âœ… Solution Applied
I've configured your `App.js` to load from your deployed website at `www.fitexplorer.se`.

## ðŸŽ¯ How to Run

### Option 1: Use the Batch File (Windows)
1. Double-click `start-expo.bat` in the `mobile-app` folder
2. This will start Expo and clear any cached data

### Option 2: Manual Steps
1. **Navigate to the Expo app directory:**
   ```bash
   cd mobile-app/FitExplorerApp
   ```

2. **Start Expo with cache clear:**
   ```bash
   npx expo start --clear
   ```

3. **Scan the QR code** with Expo Go app on your phone

## ðŸ“± What You'll See
- Your deployed FitExplorer website (www.fitexplorer.se) will load in the mobile app
- All features will work exactly like in the browser
- Users can access your live website through the mobile app

## ðŸ”§ If It Still Shows Snack URL
1. Make sure you're running `npx expo start --clear` to clear cache
2. Check that your phone and computer are on the same WiFi network
3. Try restarting Expo completely
4. Make sure your website is accessible at www.fitexplorer.se

## ðŸŽ‰ Success!
Your mobile app will now load your deployed FitExplorer website instead of showing a Snack URL!
